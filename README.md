# Premier_League_Database

This project defines the criteria on how a database should be implemented based on a Soccer League. In this case, I am taking the Premier League based in the UK.

The ER diagram shows the entity types and shows the relationships that can exist between entities. The ER diagram for the Premier League shows the different tables which should be implemented in the database. 

The Relation-Schema diagram shows how different entities are connected with minimal representation.
